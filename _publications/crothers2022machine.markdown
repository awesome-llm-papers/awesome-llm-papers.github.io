Machine generated text is increasingly difficult to distinguish from human
authored text. Powerful open-source models are freely available, and
user-friendly tools that democratize access to generative models are
proliferating. ChatGPT, which was released shortly after the first edition of
this survey, epitomizes these trends. The great potential of state-of-the-art
natural language generation (NLG) systems is tempered by the multitude of
avenues for abuse. Detection of machine generated text is a key countermeasure
for reducing abuse of NLG models, with significant technical challenges and
numerous open problems. We provide a survey that includes both 1) an extensive
analysis of threat models posed by contemporary NLG systems, and 2) the most
complete review of machine generated text detection methods to date. This
survey places machine generated text within its cybersecurity and social
context, and provides strong guidance for future work addressing the most
critical threat models, and ensuring detection systems themselves demonstrate
trustworthiness through fairness, robustness, and accountability.
