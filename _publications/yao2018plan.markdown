Automatic storytelling is challenging since it requires generating long,
coherent natural language to describes a sensible sequence of events. Despite
considerable efforts on automatic story generation in the past, prior work
either is restricted in plot planning, or can only generate stories in a narrow
domain. In this paper, we explore open-domain story generation that writes
stories given a title (topic) as input. We propose a plan-and-write
hierarchical generation framework that first plans a storyline, and then
generates a story based on the storyline. We compare two planning strategies.
The dynamic schema interweaves story planning and its surface realization in
text, while the static schema plans out the entire storyline before generating
stories. Experiments show that with explicit storyline planning, the generated
stories are more diverse, coherent, and on topic than those generated without
creating a full plan, according to both automatic and human evaluations.
