We present Sockeye 2, a modernized and streamlined version of the Sockeye
neural machine translation (NMT) toolkit. New features include a simplified
code base through the use of MXNet's Gluon API, a focus on state of the art
model architectures, distributed mixed precision training, and efficient CPU
decoding with 8-bit quantization. These improvements result in faster training
and inference, higher automatic metric scores, and a shorter path from research
to production.
