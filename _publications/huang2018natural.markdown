In conventional supervised training, a model is trained to fit all the
training examples. However, having a monolithic model may not always be the
best strategy, as examples could vary widely. In this work, we explore a
different learning protocol that treats each example as a unique pseudo-task,
by reducing the original learning problem to a few-shot meta-learning scenario
with the help of a domain-dependent relevance function. When evaluated on the
WikiSQL dataset, our approach leads to faster convergence and achieves
1.1%-5.4% absolute accuracy gains over the non-meta-learning counterparts.
