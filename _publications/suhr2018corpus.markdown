We introduce a new dataset for joint reasoning about natural language and
images, with a focus on semantic diversity, compositionality, and visual
reasoning challenges. The data contains 107,292 examples of English sentences
paired with web photographs. The task is to determine whether a natural
language caption is true about a pair of photographs. We crowdsource the data
using sets of visually rich images and a compare-and-contrast task to elicit
linguistically diverse language. Qualitative analysis shows the data requires
compositional joint reasoning, including about quantities, comparisons, and
relations. Evaluation using state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods shows the
data presents a strong challenge.
