Long-form narrative text generated from large language models manages a
fluent impersonation of human writing, but only at the local sentence level,
and lacks structure or global cohesion. We posit that many of the problems of
story generation can be addressed via high-quality content planning, and
present a system that focuses on how to learn good plot structures to guide
story generation. We utilize a plot-generation language model along with an
ensemble of rescoring models that each implement an aspect of good
story-writing as detailed in Aristotle's Poetics. We find that stories written
with our more principled plot-structure are both more relevant to a given
prompt and higher quality than baselines that do not content plan, or that plan
in an unprincipled way.
