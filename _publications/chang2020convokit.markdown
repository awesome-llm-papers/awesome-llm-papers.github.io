This paper describes the design and functionality of ConvoKit, an open-source
toolkit for analyzing conversations and the social interactions embedded
within. ConvoKit provides an unified framework for representing and
manipulating conversational data, as well as a large and diverse collection of
conversational datasets. By providing an intuitive interface for exploring and
interacting with conversational data, this toolkit lowers the technical
barriers for the broad adoption of computational methods for conversational
analysis.
