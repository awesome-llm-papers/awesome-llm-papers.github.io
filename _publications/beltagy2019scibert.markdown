Obtaining large-scale annotated data for NLP tasks in the scientific domain
is challenging and expensive. We release SciBERT, a pretrained language model
based on BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) to address the lack of high-quality,
large-scale labeled scientific data. SciBERT leverages unsupervised pretraining
on a large multi-domain corpus of scientific publications to improve
performance on downstream scientific NLP tasks. We evaluate on a suite of tasks
including sequence tagging, sentence classification and dependency parsing,
with datasets from a variety of scientific domains. We demonstrate
statistically significant improvements over BERT and achieve new
state-of-the-art results on several of these tasks. The code and pretrained
models are available at https://github.com/allenai/scibert/.
