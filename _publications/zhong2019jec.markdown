We present JEC-QA, the largest question answering dataset in the legal
domain, collected from the National Judicial Examination of China. The
examination is a comprehensive evaluation of professional skills for legal
practitioners. College students are required to pass the examination to be
certified as a lawyer or a judge. The dataset is challenging for existing
question answering methods, because both retrieving relevant materials and
answering questions require the ability of logic reasoning. Due to the high
demand of multiple reasoning abilities to answer legal questions, the
state-of-the-art models can only achieve about 28% accuracy on JEC-QA, while
skilled humans and unskilled humans can reach 81% and 64% accuracy
respectively, which indicates a huge gap between humans and machines on this
task. We will release JEC-QA and our baselines to help improve the reasoning
ability of machine comprehension models. You can access the dataset from
