Amphion is a toolkit for Audio, Music, and Speech Generation. Its purpose is to support reproducible research and help junior researchers and engineers get started in the field of audio, music, and speech generation research and development. Amphion offers a unique feature: visualizations of classic models or architectures. We believe that these visualizations are beneficial for junior researchers and engineers who wish to gain a better understanding of the model. The North-Star objective of Amphion is to offer a platform for studying the conversion of any inputs into general audio. Amphion is designed to support individual generation tasks. In addition to the specific generation tasks, Amphion also includes several vocoders and evaluation metrics. A vocoder is an important module for producing high-quality audio signals, while evaluation metrics are critical for ensuring consistent metrics in generation tasks. In this paper, we provide a high-level overview of Amphion.
