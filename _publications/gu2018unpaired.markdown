Image captioning is a multimodal task involving computer vision and natural
language processing, where the goal is to learn a mapping from the image to its
natural language description. In general, the mapping function is learned from
a training set of image-caption pairs. However, for some language, large scale
image-caption paired corpus might not be available. We present an approach to
this unpaired image captioning problem by language pivoting. Our method can
effectively capture the characteristics of an image captioner from the pivot
language (Chinese) and align it to the target language (English) using another
pivot-target (Chinese-English) sentence parallel corpus. We evaluate our method
on two image-to-English benchmark datasets: MSCOCO and Flickr30K. Quantitative
comparisons against several baseline approaches demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method.
