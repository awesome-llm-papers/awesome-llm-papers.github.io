We address whether neural models for Natural Language Inference (NLI) can
learn the compositional interactions between lexical entailment and negation,
using four methods: the behavioral evaluation methods of (1) challenge test
sets and (2) systematic generalization tasks, and the structural evaluation
methods of (3) probes and (4) interventions. To facilitate this holistic
evaluation, we present Monotonicity NLI (MoNLI), a new naturalistic dataset
focused on lexical entailment and negation. In our behavioral evaluations, we
find that models trained on general-purpose NLI datasets fail systematically on
MoNLI examples containing negation, but that MoNLI fine-tuning addresses this
failure. In our structural evaluations, we look for evidence that our
top-performing BERT-based model has learned to implement the monotonicity
algorithm behind MoNLI. Probes yield evidence consistent with this conclusion,
and our intervention experiments bolster this, showing that the causal dynamics
of the model mirror the causal dynamics of this algorithm on subsets of MoNLI.
This suggests that the BERT model at least partially embeds a theory of lexical
entailment and negation at an algorithmic level.
