Existing approaches to recipe generation are unable to create recipes for
users with culinary preferences but incomplete knowledge of ingredients in
specific dishes. We propose a new task of personalized recipe generation to
help these users: expanding a name and incomplete ingredient details into
complete natural-text instructions aligned with the user's historical
preferences. We attend on technique- and recipe-level representations of a
user's previously consumed recipes, fusing these 'user-aware' representations
in an attention fusion layer to control recipe text generation. Experiments on
a new dataset of 180K recipes and 700K interactions show our model's ability to
generate plausible and personalized recipes compared to non-personalized
baselines.
