In this work we release our extensible and easily configurable neural network
training software. It provides a rich set of functional layers with a
particular focus on efficient training of recurrent neural network topologies
on multiple GPUs. The source of the software package is public and freely
available for academic research purposes and can be used as a framework or as a
standalone tool which supports a flexible configuration. The software allows to
train state-of-the-art deep bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) models
on both one dimensional data like speech or two dimensional data like
handwritten text and was used to develop successful submission systems in
several evaluation campaigns.
