Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds the potential to transform
the delivery, cultivation, and evaluation of human learning. This Perspective
examines the integration of GenAI as a tool for human learning, addressing its
promises and challenges from a holistic viewpoint that integrates insights from
learning sciences, educational technology, and human-computer interaction.
GenAI promises to enhance learning experiences by scaling personalised support,
diversifying learning materials, enabling timely feedback, and innovating
assessment methods. However, it also presents critical issues such as model
imperfections, ethical dilemmas, and the disruption of traditional assessments.
Cultivating AI literacy and adaptive skills is imperative for facilitating
informed engagement with GenAI technologies. Rigorous research across learning
contexts is essential to evaluate GenAI's impact on human cognition,
metacognition, and creativity. Humanity must learn with and about GenAI,
ensuring it becomes a powerful ally in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation,
rather than a crutch that undermines our intellectual abilities.
