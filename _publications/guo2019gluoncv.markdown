We present GluonCV and GluonNLP, the deep learning toolkits for computer
vision and natural language processing based on Apache MXNet (incubating).
These toolkits provide state-of-the-art pre-trained models, training scripts,
and training logs, to facilitate rapid prototyping and promote reproducible
research. We also provide modular APIs with flexible building blocks to enable
efficient customization. Leveraging the MXNet ecosystem, the deep learning
models in GluonCV and GluonNLP can be deployed onto a variety of platforms with
different programming languages. The Apache 2.0 license has been adopted by
GluonCV and GluonNLP to allow for software distribution, modification, and
usage.
