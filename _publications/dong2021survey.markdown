This paper offers a comprehensive review of the research on Natural Language
Generation (NLG) over the past two decades, especially in relation to
data-to-text generation and text-to-text generation deep learning methods, as
well as new applications of NLG technology. This survey aims to (a) give the
latest synthesis of deep learning research on the NLG core tasks, as well as
the architectures adopted in the field; (b) detail meticulously and
comprehensively various NLG tasks and datasets, and draw attention to the
challenges in NLG evaluation, focusing on different evaluation methods and
their relationships; (c) highlight some future emphasis and relatively recent
research issues that arise due to the increasing synergy between NLG and other
artificial intelligence areas, such as computer vision, text and computational
creativity.
