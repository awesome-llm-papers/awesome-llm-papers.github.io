We present a large-scale collection of diverse natural language inference
(NLI) datasets that help provide insight into how well a sentence
representation captures distinct types of reasoning. The collection results
from recasting 13 existing datasets from 7 semantic phenomena into a common NLI
structure, resulting in over half a million labeled context-hypothesis pairs in
total. We refer to our collection as the DNC: Diverse Natural Language
Inference Collection. The DNC is available online at https://www.decomp.net,
and will grow over time as additional resources are recast and added from novel
sources.
