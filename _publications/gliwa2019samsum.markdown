This paper introduces the SAMSum Corpus, a new dataset with abstractive
dialogue summaries. We investigate the challenges it poses for automated
summarization by testing several models and comparing their results with those
obtained on a corpus of news articles. We show that model-generated summaries
of dialogues achieve higher ROUGE scores than the model-generated summaries of
news -- in contrast with human evaluators' judgement. This suggests that a
challenging task of abstractive dialogue summarization requires dedicated
models and non-standard quality measures. To our knowledge, our study is the
first attempt to introduce a high-quality chat-dialogues corpus, manually
annotated with abstractive summarizations, which can be used by the research
community for further studies.
