In this paper, we observe that semi-structured tabulated text is ubiquitous;
understanding them requires not only comprehending the meaning of text
fragments, but also implicit relationships between them. We argue that such
data can prove as a testing ground for understanding how we reason about
information. To study this, we introduce a new dataset called INFOTABS,
comprising of human-written textual hypotheses based on premises that are
tables extracted from Wikipedia info-boxes. Our analysis shows that the
semi-structured, multi-domain and heterogeneous nature of the premises admits
complex, multi-faceted reasoning. Experiments reveal that, while human
annotators agree on the relationships between a table-hypothesis pair, several
standard modeling strategies are unsuccessful at the task, suggesting that
reasoning about tables can pose a difficult modeling challenge.
