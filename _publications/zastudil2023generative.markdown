Generative models are now capable of producing natural language text that is,
in some cases, comparable in quality to the text produced by people. In the
computing education context, these models are being used to generate code, code
explanations, and programming exercises. The rapid adoption of these models has
prompted multiple position papers and workshops which discuss the implications
of these models for computing education, both positive and negative. This paper
presents results from a series of semi-structured interviews with 12 students
and 6 instructors about their awareness, experiences, and preferences regarding
the use of tools powered by generative AI in computing classrooms. The results
suggest that Generative AI (GAI) tools will play an increasingly significant
role in computing education. However, students and instructors also raised
numerous concerns about how these models should be integrated to best support
the needs and learning goals of students. We also identified interesting
tensions and alignments that emerged between how instructors and students
prefer to engage with these models. We discuss these results and provide
recommendations related to curriculum development, assessment methods, and
pedagogical practice. As GAI tools become increasingly prevalent, it's
important to understand educational stakeholders' preferences and values to
ensure that these tools can be used for good and that potential harms can be
mitigated.
