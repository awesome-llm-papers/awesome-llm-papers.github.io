Generating a reasonable ending for a given story context, i.e., story ending
generation, is a strong indication of story comprehension. This task requires
not only to understand the context clues which play an important role in
planning the plot but also to handle implicit knowledge to make a reasonable,
coherent story.
  In this paper, we devise a novel model for story ending generation. The model
adopts an incremental encoding scheme to represent context clues which are
spanning in the story context. In addition, commonsense knowledge is applied
through multi-source attention to facilitate story comprehension, and thus to
help generate coherent and reasonable endings. Through building context clues
and using implicit knowledge, the model is able to produce reasonable story
endings. context clues implied in the post and make the inference based on it.
  Automatic and manual evaluation shows that our model can generate more
reasonable story endings than state-of-the-art baselines.
