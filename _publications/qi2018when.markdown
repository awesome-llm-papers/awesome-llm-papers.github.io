The performance of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems often suffers in
low-resource scenarios where sufficiently large-scale parallel corpora cannot
be obtained. Pre-trained word embeddings have proven to be invaluable for
improving performance in natural language analysis tasks, which often suffer
from paucity of data. However, their utility for NMT has not been extensively
explored. In this work, we perform five sets of experiments that analyze when
we can expect pre-trained word embeddings to help in NMT tasks. We show that
such embeddings can be surprisingly effective in some cases -- providing gains
of up to 20 BLEU points in the most favorable setting.
