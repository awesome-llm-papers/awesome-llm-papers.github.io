Recent advances in generative pre-trained transformer large language models
have emphasised the potential risks of unfair use of artificial intelligence
(AI) generated content in an academic environment and intensified efforts in
searching for solutions to detect such content. The paper examines the general
functionality of detection tools for artificial intelligence generated text and
evaluates them based on accuracy and error type analysis. Specifically, the
study seeks to answer research questions about whether existing detection tools
can reliably differentiate between human-written text and ChatGPT-generated
text, and whether machine translation and content obfuscation techniques affect
the detection of AI-generated text. The research covers 12 publicly available
tools and two commercial systems (Turnitin and PlagiarismCheck) that are widely
used in the academic setting. The researchers conclude that the available
detection tools are neither accurate nor reliable and have a main bias towards
classifying the output as human-written rather than detecting AI-generated
text. Furthermore, content obfuscation techniques significantly worsen the
performance of tools. The study makes several significant contributions. First,
it summarises up-to-date similar scientific and non-scientific efforts in the
field. Second, it presents the result of one of the most comprehensive tests
conducted so far, based on a rigorous research methodology, an original
document set, and a broad coverage of tools. Third, it discusses the
implications and drawbacks of using detection tools for AI-generated text in
academic settings.
