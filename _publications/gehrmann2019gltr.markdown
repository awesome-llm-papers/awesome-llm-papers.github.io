The rapid improvement of language models has raised the specter of abuse of
text generation systems. This progress motivates the development of simple
methods for detecting generated text that can be used by and explained to
non-experts. We develop GLTR, a tool to support humans in detecting whether a
text was generated by a model. GLTR applies a suite of baseline statistical
methods that can detect generation artifacts across common sampling schemes. In
a human-subjects study, we show that the annotation scheme provided by GLTR
improves the human detection-rate of fake text from 54% to 72% without any
prior training. GLTR is open-source and publicly deployed, and has already been
widely used to detect generated outputs
