When humans learn to perform a difficult task (say, reading comprehension
(RC) over longer passages), it is typically the case that their performance
improves significantly on an easier version of this task (say, RC over shorter
passages). Ideally, we would want an intelligent agent to also exhibit such a
behavior. However, on experimenting with state of the art RC models using the
standard RACE dataset, we observe that this is not true. Specifically, we see
counter-intuitive results wherein even when we show frustratingly easy examples
to the model at test time, there is hardly any improvement in its performance.
We refer to this as non-adversarial evaluation as opposed to adversarial
evaluation. Such non-adversarial examples allow us to assess the utility of
specialized neural components. For example, we show that even for easy examples
where the answer is clearly embedded in the passage, the neural components
designed for paying attention to relevant portions of the passage fail to serve
their intended purpose. We believe that the non-adversarial dataset created as
a part of this work would complement the research on adversarial evaluation and
give a more realistic assessment of the ability of RC models. All the datasets
and codes developed as a part of this work will be made publicly available.
