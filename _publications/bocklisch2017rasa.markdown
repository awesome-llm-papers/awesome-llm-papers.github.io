We introduce a pair of tools, Rasa NLU and Rasa Core, which are open source
python libraries for building conversational software. Their purpose is to make
machine-learning based dialogue management and language understanding
accessible to non-specialist software developers. In terms of design
philosophy, we aim for ease of use, and bootstrapping from minimal (or no)
initial training data. Both packages are extensively documented and ship with a
comprehensive suite of tests. The code is available at
