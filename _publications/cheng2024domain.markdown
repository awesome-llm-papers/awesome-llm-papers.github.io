Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of general multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, adapting general MLLMs to specific domains, such as scientific fields and industrial applications, remains less explored. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs through post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipelines, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using open-source models, we develop a visual instruction synthesizer that effectively generates diverse visual instruction tasks from domain-specific image-caption pairs. Our synthetic tasks surpass those generated by manual rules, GPT-4, and GPT-4V in enhancing the domain-specific performance of MLLMs. (2) Training Pipeline: While the two-stage training--initially on image-caption pairs followed by visual instruction tasks--is commonly adopted for developing general MLLMs, we apply a single-stage training pipeline to enhance task diversity for domain-specific post-training. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct experiments in two domains, biomedicine and food, by post-training MLLMs of different sources and scales (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B, LLaVA-v1.6-8B, Llama-3.2-11B), and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. To support further research in MLLM domain adaptation, we will open-source our implementations.
