We introduce Mixtral 8x7B, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) language model.
Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each
layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at
each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state
and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the
selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has
access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference.
Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or
matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular,
Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and
multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow
instructions, Mixtral 8x7B - Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo,
Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B - chat model on human benchmarks. Both
the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.
