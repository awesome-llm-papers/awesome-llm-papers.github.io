Artificial intelligence (AI) is now widely used to facilitate social
interaction, but its impact on social relationships and communication is not
well understood. We study the social consequences of one of the most pervasive
AI applications: algorithmic response suggestions ("smart replies"). Two
randomized experiments (n = 1036) provide evidence that a commercially-deployed
AI changes how people interact with and perceive one another in pro-social and
anti-social ways. We find that using algorithmic responses increases
communication efficiency, use of positive emotional language, and positive
evaluations by communication partners. However, consistent with common
assumptions about the negative implications of AI, people are evaluated more
negatively if they are suspected to be using algorithmic responses. Thus, even
though AI can increase communication efficiency and improve interpersonal
perceptions, it risks changing users' language production and continues to be
viewed negatively.
