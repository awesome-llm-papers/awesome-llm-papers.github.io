Modern Machine Translation (MT) systems perform consistently well on clean,
in-domain text. However most human generated text, particularly in the realm of
social media, is full of typos, slang, dialect, idiolect and other noise which
can have a disastrous impact on the accuracy of output translation. In this
paper we leverage the Machine Translation of Noisy Text (MTNT) dataset to
enhance the robustness of MT systems by emulating naturally occurring noise in
otherwise clean data. Synthesizing noise in this manner we are ultimately able
to make a vanilla MT system resilient to naturally occurring noise and
partially mitigate loss in accuracy resulting therefrom.
