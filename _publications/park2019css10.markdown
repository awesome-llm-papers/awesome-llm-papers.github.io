We describe our development of CSS10, a collection of single speaker speech
datasets for ten languages. It is composed of short audio clips from LibriVox
audiobooks and their aligned texts. To validate its quality we train two neural
text-to-speech models on each dataset. Subsequently, we conduct Mean Opinion
Score tests on the synthesized speech samples. We make our datasets,
pre-trained models, and test resources publicly available. We hope they will be
used for future speech tasks.
