We present the results from the second shared task on multimodal machine
translation and multilingual image description. Nine teams submitted 19 systems
to two tasks. The multimodal translation task, in which the source sentence is
supplemented by an image, was extended with a new language (French) and two new
test sets. The multilingual image description task was changed such that at
test time, only the image is given. Compared to last year, multimodal systems
improved, but text-only systems remain competitive.
