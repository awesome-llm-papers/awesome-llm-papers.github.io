In this work we explore recent advances in Recurrent Neural Networks for
large scale Language Modeling, a task central to language understanding. We
extend current models to deal with two key challenges present in this task:
corpora and vocabulary sizes, and complex, long term structure of language. We
perform an exhaustive study on techniques such as character Convolutional
Neural Networks or Long-Short Term Memory, on the One Billion Word Benchmark.
Our best single model significantly improves state-of-the-art perplexity from
51.3 down to 30.0 (whilst reducing the number of parameters by a factor of 20),
while an ensemble of models sets a new record by improving perplexity from 41.0
down to 23.7. We also release these models for the NLP and ML community to
study and improve upon.
