Existing work on augmenting question answering (QA) models with external
knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs) either struggle to model multi-hop relations
efficiently, or lack transparency into the model's prediction rationale. In
this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-aware approach that equips pre-trained
language models (PTLMs) with a multi-hop relational reasoning module, named
multi-hop graph relation network (MHGRN). It performs multi-hop,
multi-relational reasoning over subgraphs extracted from external knowledge
graphs. The proposed reasoning module unifies path-based reasoning methods and
graph neural networks to achieve better interpretability and scalability. We
also empirically show its effectiveness and scalability on CommonsenseQA and
OpenbookQA datasets, and interpret its behaviors with case studies.
