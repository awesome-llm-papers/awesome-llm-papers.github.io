Document-level context has received lots of attention for compensating neural
machine translation (NMT) of isolated sentences. However, recent advances in
document-level NMT focus on sophisticated integration of the context,
explaining its improvement with only a few selected examples or targeted test
sets. We extensively quantify the causes of improvements by a document-level
model in general test sets, clarifying the limit of the usefulness of
document-level context in NMT. We show that most of the improvements are not
interpretable as utilizing the context. We also show that a minimal encoding is
sufficient for the context modeling and very long context is not helpful for
NMT.
