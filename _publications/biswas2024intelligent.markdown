Comprehensive clinical documentation is crucial for effective healthcare
delivery, yet it poses a significant burden on healthcare professionals,
leading to burnout, increased medical errors, and compromised patient safety.
This paper explores the potential of generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to
streamline the clinical documentation process, specifically focusing on
generating SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) and BIRP (Behavior,
Intervention, Response, Plan) notes. We present a case study demonstrating the
application of natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech
recognition (ASR) technologies to transcribe patient-clinician interactions,
coupled with advanced prompting techniques to generate draft clinical notes
using large language models (LLMs). The study highlights the benefits of this
approach, including time savings, improved documentation quality, and enhanced
patient-centered care. Additionally, we discuss ethical considerations, such as
maintaining patient confidentiality and addressing model biases, underscoring
the need for responsible deployment of generative AI in healthcare settings.
The findings suggest that generative AI has the potential to revolutionize
clinical documentation practices, alleviating administrative burdens and
enabling healthcare professionals to focus more on direct patient care.
