This paper presents the Frames dataset (Frames is available at
http://datasets.maluuba.com/Frames), a corpus of 1369 human-human dialogues
with an average of 15 turns per dialogue. We developed this dataset to study
the role of memory in goal-oriented dialogue systems. Based on Frames, we
introduce a task called frame tracking, which extends state tracking to a
setting where several states are tracked simultaneously. We propose a baseline
model for this task. We show that Frames can also be used to study memory in
dialogue management and information presentation through natural language
generation.
