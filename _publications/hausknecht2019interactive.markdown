A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to understand and communicate
with language. Interactive Fiction games are fully text-based simulation
environments where a player issues text commands to effect change in the
environment and progress through the story. We argue that IF games are an
excellent testbed for studying language-based autonomous agents. In particular,
IF games combine challenges of combinatorial action spaces, language
understanding, and commonsense reasoning. To facilitate rapid development of
language-based agents, we introduce Jericho, a learning environment for
man-made IF games and conduct a comprehensive study of text-agents across a
rich set of games, highlighting directions in which agents can improve.
