This paper presents a new method --- adversarial advantage actor-critic
(Adversarial A2C), which significantly improves the efficiency of dialogue
policy learning in task-completion dialogue systems. Inspired by generative
adversarial networks (GAN), we train a discriminator to differentiate
responses/actions generated by dialogue agents from responses/actions by
experts. Then, we incorporate the discriminator as another critic into the
advantage actor-critic (A2C) framework, to encourage the dialogue agent to
explore state-action within the regions where the agent takes actions similar
to those of the experts. Experimental results in a movie-ticket booking domain
show that the proposed Adversarial A2C can accelerate policy exploration
efficiently.
