Following recent successes in applying BERT to question answering, we explore
simple applications to ad hoc document retrieval. This required confronting the
challenge posed by documents that are typically longer than the length of input
BERT was designed to handle. We address this issue by applying inference on
sentences individually, and then aggregating sentence scores to produce
document scores. Experiments on TREC microblog and newswire test collections
show that our approach is simple yet effective, as we report the highest
average precision on these datasets by neural approaches that we are aware of.
