This paper examines various unsupervised pretraining objectives for learning
dialog context representations. Two novel methods of pretraining dialog context
encoders are proposed, and a total of four methods are examined. Each
pretraining objective is fine-tuned and evaluated on a set of downstream dialog
tasks using the MultiWoz dataset and strong performance improvement is
observed. Further evaluation shows that our pretraining objectives result in
not only better performance, but also better convergence, models that are less
data hungry and have better domain generalizability.
