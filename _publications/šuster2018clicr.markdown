We present a new dataset for machine comprehension in the medical domain. Our
dataset uses clinical case reports with around 100,000 gap-filling queries
about these cases. We apply several baselines and state-of-the-art neural
readers to the dataset, and observe a considerable gap in performance (20% F1)
between the best human and machine readers. We analyze the skills required for
successful answering and show how reader performance varies depending on the
applicable skills. We find that inferences using domain knowledge and object
tracking are the most frequently required skills, and that recognizing omitted
information and spatio-temporal reasoning are the most difficult for the
machines.
