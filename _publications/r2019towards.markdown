In light of the recent breakthroughs in automatic machine translation
systems, we propose a novel approach that we term as "Face-to-Face
Translation". As today's digital communication becomes increasingly visual, we
argue that there is a need for systems that can automatically translate a video
of a person speaking in language A into a target language B with realistic lip
synchronization. In this work, we create an automatic pipeline for this problem
and demonstrate its impact on multiple real-world applications. First, we build
a working speech-to-speech translation system by bringing together multiple
existing modules from speech and language. We then move towards "Face-to-Face
Translation" by incorporating a novel visual module, LipGAN for generating
realistic talking faces from the translated audio. Quantitative evaluation of
LipGAN on the standard LRW test set shows that it significantly outperforms
existing approaches across all standard metrics. We also subject our
Face-to-Face Translation pipeline, to multiple human evaluations and show that
it can significantly improve the overall user experience for consuming and
interacting with multimodal content across languages. Code, models and demo
video are made publicly available.
