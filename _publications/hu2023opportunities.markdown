Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing have opened up new
possibilities for the development of large language models like ChatGPT, which
can facilitate knowledge management in the design process by providing
designers with access to a vast array of relevant information. However,
integrating ChatGPT into the design process also presents new challenges. In
this paper, we provide a concise review of the classification and
representation of design knowledge, and past efforts to support designers in
acquiring knowledge. We analyze the opportunities and challenges that ChatGPT
presents for knowledge management in design and propose promising future
research directions. A case study is conducted to validate the advantages and
drawbacks of ChatGPT, showing that designers can acquire targeted knowledge
from various domains, but the quality of the acquired knowledge is highly
dependent on the prompt.
