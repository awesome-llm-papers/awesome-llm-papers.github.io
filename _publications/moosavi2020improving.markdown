Existing NLP datasets contain various biases, and models tend to quickly
learn those biases, which in turn limits their robustness. Existing approaches
to improve robustness against dataset biases mostly focus on changing the
training objective so that models learn less from biased examples. Besides,
they mostly focus on addressing a specific bias, and while they improve the
performance on adversarial evaluation sets of the targeted bias, they may bias
the model in other ways, and therefore, hurt the overall robustness. In this
paper, we propose to augment the input sentences in the training data with
their corresponding predicate-argument structures, which provide a higher-level
abstraction over different realizations of the same meaning and help the model
to recognize important parts of sentences. We show that without targeting a
specific bias, our sentence augmentation improves the robustness of transformer
models against multiple biases. In addition, we show that models can still be
vulnerable to the lexical overlap bias, even when the training data does not
contain this bias, and that the sentence augmentation also improves the
robustness in this scenario. We will release our adversarial datasets to
evaluate bias in such a scenario as well as our augmentation scripts at
