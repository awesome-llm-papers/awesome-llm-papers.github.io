Natural language generation lies at the core of generative dialogue systems
and conversational agents. We describe an ensemble neural language generator,
and present several novel methods for data representation and augmentation that
yield improved results in our model. We test the model on three datasets in the
restaurant, TV and laptop domains, and report both objective and subjective
evaluations of our best model. Using a range of automatic metrics, as well as
human evaluators, we show that our approach achieves better results than
state-of-the-art models on the same datasets.
