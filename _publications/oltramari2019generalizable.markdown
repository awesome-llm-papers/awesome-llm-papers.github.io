This chapter illustrates how suitable neuro-symbolic models for language
understanding can enable domain generalizability and robustness in downstream
tasks. Different methods for integrating neural language models and knowledge
graphs are discussed. The situations in which this combination is most
appropriate are characterized, including quantitative evaluation and
qualitative error analysis on a variety of commonsense question answering
benchmark datasets.
