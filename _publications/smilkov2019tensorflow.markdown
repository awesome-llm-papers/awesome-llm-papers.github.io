TensorFlow.js is a library for building and executing machine learning
algorithms in JavaScript. TensorFlow.js models run in a web browser and in the
Node.js environment. The library is part of the TensorFlow ecosystem, providing
a set of APIs that are compatible with those in Python, allowing models to be
ported between the Python and JavaScript ecosystems. TensorFlow.js has
empowered a new set of developers from the extensive JavaScript community to
build and deploy machine learning models and enabled new classes of on-device
computation. This paper describes the design, API, and implementation of
TensorFlow.js, and highlights some of the impactful use cases.
