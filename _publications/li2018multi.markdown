Multi-head attention is appealing for the ability to jointly attend to
information from different representation subspaces at different positions. In
this work, we introduce a disagreement regularization to explicitly encourage
the diversity among multiple attention heads. Specifically, we propose three
types of disagreement regularization, which respectively encourage the
subspace, the attended positions, and the output representation associated with
each attention head to be different from other heads. Experimental results on
widely-used WMT14 English-German and WMT17 Chinese-English translation tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed approach.
