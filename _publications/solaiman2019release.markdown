Large language models have a range of beneficial uses: they can assist in
prose, poetry, and programming; analyze dataset biases; and more. However,
their flexibility and generative capabilities also raise misuse concerns. This
report discusses OpenAI's work related to the release of its GPT-2 language
model. It discusses staged release, which allows time between model releases to
conduct risk and benefit analyses as model sizes increased. It also discusses
ongoing partnership-based research and provides recommendations for better
coordination and responsible publication in AI.
