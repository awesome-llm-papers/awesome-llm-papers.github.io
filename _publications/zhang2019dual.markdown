Multi-choice reading comprehension is a challenging task that requires
complex reasoning procedure. Given passage and question, a correct answer need
to be selected from a set of candidate answers. In this paper, we propose
\textbf\{D\}ual \textbf\{C\}o-\textbf\{M\}atching \textbf\{N\}etwork (\textbf\{DCMN\})
which model the relationship among passage, question and answer
bidirectionally. Different from existing approaches which only calculate
question-aware or option-aware passage representation, we calculate
passage-aware question representation and passage-aware answer representation
at the same time. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate
our model on a large-scale multiple choice machine reading comprehension
dataset (i.e. RACE). Experimental result show that our proposed model achieves
new state-of-the-art results.
