We describe PARANMT-50M, a dataset of more than 50 million English-English
sentential paraphrase pairs. We generated the pairs automatically by using
neural machine translation to translate the non-English side of a large
parallel corpus, following Wieting et al. (2017). Our hope is that ParaNMT-50M
can be a valuable resource for paraphrase generation and can provide a rich
source of semantic knowledge to improve downstream natural language
understanding tasks. To show its utility, we use ParaNMT-50M to train
paraphrastic sentence embeddings that outperform all supervised systems on
every SemEval semantic textual similarity competition, in addition to showing
how it can be used for paraphrase generation.
