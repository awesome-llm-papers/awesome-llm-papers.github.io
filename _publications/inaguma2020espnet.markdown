We present ESPnet-ST, which is designed for the quick development of
speech-to-speech translation systems in a single framework. ESPnet-ST is a new
project inside end-to-end speech processing toolkit, ESPnet, which integrates
or newly implements automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and
text-to-speech functions for speech translation. We provide all-in-one recipes
including data pre-processing, feature extraction, training, and decoding
pipelines for a wide range of benchmark datasets. Our reproducible results can
match or even outperform the current state-of-the-art performances; these
pre-trained models are downloadable. The toolkit is publicly available at
https://github.com/espnet/espnet.
