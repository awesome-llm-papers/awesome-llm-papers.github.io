Understanding procedural language requires anticipating the causal effects of
actions, even when they are not explicitly stated. In this work, we introduce
Neural Process Networks to understand procedural text through (neural)
simulation of action dynamics. Our model complements existing memory
architectures with dynamic entity tracking by explicitly modeling actions as
state transformers. The model updates the states of the entities by executing
learned action operators. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed model
can reason about the unstated causal effects of actions, allowing it to provide
more accurate contextual information for understanding and generating
procedural text, all while offering more interpretable internal representations
than existing alternatives.
