Large language models have recently attracted significant attention due to
their impressive performance on a variety of tasks. ChatGPT developed by OpenAI
is one such implementation of a large, pre-trained language model that has
gained immense popularity among early adopters, where certain users go to the
extent of characterizing it as a disruptive technology in many domains.
Understanding such early adopters' sentiments is important because it can
provide insights into the potential success or failure of the technology, as
well as its strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we conduct a mixed-method
study using 10,732 tweets from early ChatGPT users. We first use topic
modelling to identify the main topics and then perform an in-depth qualitative
sentiment analysis of each topic. Our results show that the majority of the
early adopters have expressed overwhelmingly positive sentiments related to
topics such as Disruptions to software development, Entertainment and
exercising creativity. Only a limited percentage of users expressed concerns
about issues such as the potential for misuse of ChatGPT, especially regarding
topics such as Impact on educational aspects. We discuss these findings by
providing specific examples for each topic and then detail implications related
to addressing these concerns for both researchers and users.
