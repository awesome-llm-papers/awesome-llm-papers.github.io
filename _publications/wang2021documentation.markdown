Computational notebooks allow data scientists to express their ideas through
a combination of code and documentation. However, data scientists often pay
attention only to the code, and neglect creating or updating their
documentation during quick iterations. Inspired by human documentation
practices learned from 80 highly-voted Kaggle notebooks, we design and
implement Themisto, an automated documentation generation system to explore how
human-centered AI systems can support human data scientists in the machine
learning code documentation scenario. Themisto facilitates the creation of
documentation via three approaches: a deep-learning-based approach to generate
documentation for source code, a query-based approach to retrieve online API
documentation for source code, and a user prompt approach to nudge users to
write documentation. We evaluated Themisto in a within-subjects experiment with
24 data science practitioners, and found that automated documentation
generation techniques reduced the time for writing documentation, reminded
participants to document code they would have ignored, and improved
participants' satisfaction with their computational notebook.
