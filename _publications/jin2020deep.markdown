Text style transfer is an important task in natural language generation,
which aims to control certain attributes in the generated text, such as
politeness, emotion, humor, and many others. It has a long history in the field
of natural language processing, and recently has re-gained significant
attention thanks to the promising performance brought by deep neural models. In
this paper, we present a systematic survey of the research on neural text style
transfer, spanning over 100 representative articles since the first neural text
style transfer work in 2017. We discuss the task formulation, existing datasets
and subtasks, evaluation, as well as the rich methodologies in the presence of
parallel and non-parallel data. We also provide discussions on a variety of
important topics regarding the future development of this task. Our curated
