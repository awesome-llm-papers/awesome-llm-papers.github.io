This proposal introduces a Dialogue Challenge for building end-to-end
task-completion dialogue systems, with the goal of encouraging the dialogue
research community to collaborate and benchmark on standard datasets and
unified experimental environment. In this special session, we will release
human-annotated conversational data in three domains (movie-ticket booking,
restaurant reservation, and taxi booking), as well as an experiment platform
with built-in simulators in each domain, for training and evaluation purposes.
The final submitted systems will be evaluated both in simulated setting and by
human judges.
