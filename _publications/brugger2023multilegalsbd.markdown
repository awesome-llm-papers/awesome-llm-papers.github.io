Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) is one of the foundational building blocks
of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with incorrectly split sentences heavily
influencing the output quality of downstream tasks. It is a challenging task
for algorithms, especially in the legal domain, considering the complex and
different sentence structures used. In this work, we curated a diverse
multilingual legal dataset consisting of over 130'000 annotated sentences in 6
languages. Our experimental results indicate that the performance of existing
SBD models is subpar on multilingual legal data. We trained and tested
monolingual and multilingual models based on CRF, BiLSTM-CRF, and transformers,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. We also show that our multilingual
models outperform all baselines in the zero-shot setting on a Portuguese test
set. To encourage further research and development by the community, we have
made our dataset, models, and code publicly available.
