The enormous scale of state-of-the-art foundation models has limited their accessibility to scientists, because customized experiments at large model sizes require costly hardware and complex engineering that is impractical for most researchers. To alleviate these problems, we introduce NNsight, an open-source Python package with a simple, flexible API that can express interventions on any PyTorch model by building computation graphs. We also introduce NDIF, a collaborative research platform providing researchers access to foundation-scale LLMs via the NNsight API. Code, documentation, and tutorials are available at https://www.nnsight.net.
