This paper is concerned with paraphrase detection. The ability to detect
similar sentences written in natural language is crucial for several
applications, such as text mining, text summarization, plagiarism detection,
authorship authentication and question answering. Given two sentences, the
objective is to detect whether they are semantically identical. An important
insight from this work is that existing paraphrase systems perform well when
applied on clean texts, but they do not necessarily deliver good performance
against noisy texts. Challenges with paraphrase detection on user generated
short texts, such as Twitter, include language irregularity and noise. To cope
with these challenges, we propose a novel deep neural network-based approach
that relies on coarse-grained sentence modeling using a convolutional neural
network and a long short-term memory model, combined with a specific
fine-grained word-level similarity matching model. Our experimental results
show that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches on user-generated noisy social media data, such as Twitter texts,
and achieves highly competitive performance on a cleaner corpus.
