We present a neural model for question generation from knowledge base triples
in a "Zero-Shot" setup, that is generating questions for triples containing
predicates, subject types or object types that were not seen at training time.
Our model leverages triples occurrences in the natural language corpus in an
encoder-decoder architecture, paired with an original part-of-speech copy
action mechanism to generate questions. Benchmark and human evaluation show
that our model sets a new state-of-the-art for zero-shot QG.
