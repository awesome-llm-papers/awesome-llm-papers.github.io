Privacy policies are long and complex documents that are difficult for users
to read and understand, and yet, they have legal effects on how user data is
collected, managed and used. Ideally, we would like to empower users to inform
themselves about issues that matter to them, and enable them to selectively
explore those issues. We present PrivacyQA, a corpus consisting of 1750
questions about the privacy policies of mobile applications, and over 3500
expert annotations of relevant answers. We observe that a strong neural
baseline underperforms human performance by almost 0.3 F1 on PrivacyQA,
suggesting considerable room for improvement for future systems. Further, we
use this dataset to shed light on challenges to question answerability, with
domain-general implications for any question answering system. The PrivacyQA
corpus offers a challenging corpus for question answering, with genuine
real-world utility.
