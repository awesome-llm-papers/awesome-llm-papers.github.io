Neural Machine translation is a challenging task due to the inherent complex
nature and the fluidity that natural languages bring. Nonetheless, in recent
years, it has achieved state-of-the-art performance in several language pairs.
Although, a lot of traction can be seen in the areas of multilingual neural
machine translation (MNMT) in the recent years, there are no comprehensive
survey done to identify what approaches work well. The goal of this paper is to
investigate the realm of low resource languages and build a Neural Machine
Translation model to achieve state-of-the-art results. The paper looks to build
upon the mBART language model and explore strategies to augment it with various
NLP and Deep Learning techniques like back translation and transfer learning.
This implementation tries to unpack the architecture of the NMT application and
determine the different components which offers us opportunities to amend the
said application within the purview of the low resource languages problem
space.
