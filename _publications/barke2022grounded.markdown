Powered by recent advances in code-generating models, AI assistants like
Github Copilot promise to change the face of programming forever. But what is
this new face of programming? We present the first grounded theory analysis of
how programmers interact with Copilot, based on observing 20 participants--with
a range of prior experience using the assistant--as they solve diverse
programming tasks across four languages. Our main finding is that interactions
with programming assistants are bimodal: in acceleration mode, the programmer
knows what to do next and uses Copilot to get there faster; in exploration
mode, the programmer is unsure how to proceed and uses Copilot to explore their
options. Based on our theory, we provide recommendations for improving the
usability of future AI programming assistants.
