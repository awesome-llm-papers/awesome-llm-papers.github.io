This study aimed to explore the experiences, perceptions, knowledge,
concerns, and intentions of Gen Z students with Gen X and Gen Y teachers
regarding the use of generative AI (GenAI) in higher education. A sample of
students and teachers were recruited to investigate the above using a survey
consisting of both open and closed questions. The findings showed that Gen Z
participants were generally optimistic about the potential benefits of GenAI,
including enhanced productivity, efficiency, and personalized learning, and
expressed intentions to use GenAI for various educational purposes. Gen X and
Gen Y teachers acknowledged the potential benefits of GenAI but expressed
heightened concerns about overreliance, ethical and pedagogical implications,
emphasizing the need for proper guidelines and policies to ensure responsible
use of the technology. The study highlighted the importance of combining
technology with traditional teaching methods to provide a more effective
learning experience. Implications of the findings include the need to develop
evidence-based guidelines and policies for GenAI integration, foster critical
thinking and digital literacy skills among students, and promote responsible
use of GenAI technologies in higher education.
