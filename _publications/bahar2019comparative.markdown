Recent advances in deep learning show that end-to-end speech to text
translation model is a promising approach to direct the speech translation
field. In this work, we provide an overview of different end-to-end
architectures, as well as the usage of an auxiliary connectionist temporal
classification (CTC) loss for better convergence. We also investigate on
pre-training variants such as initializing different components of a model
using pre-trained models, and their impact on the final performance, which
gives boosts up to 4% in BLEU and 5% in TER. Our experiments are performed on
270h IWSLT TED-talks En->De, and 100h LibriSpeech Audiobooks En->Fr. We also
show improvements over the current end-to-end state-of-the-art systems on both
tasks.
