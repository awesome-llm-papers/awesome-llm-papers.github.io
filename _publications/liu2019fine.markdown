BERT, a pre-trained Transformer model, has achieved ground-breaking
performance on multiple NLP tasks. In this paper, we describe BERTSUM, a simple
variant of BERT, for extractive summarization. Our system is the state of the
art on the CNN/Dailymail dataset, outperforming the previous best-performed
system by 1.65 on ROUGE-L. The codes to reproduce our results are available at
