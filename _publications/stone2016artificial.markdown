In September 2016, Stanford's "One Hundred Year Study on Artificial
Intelligence" project (AI100) issued the first report of its planned long-term
periodic assessment of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on society.
It was written by a panel of 17 study authors, each of whom is deeply rooted in
AI research, chaired by Peter Stone of the University of Texas at Austin. The
report, entitled "Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030," examines eight
domains of typical urban settings on which AI is likely to have impact over the
coming years: transportation, home and service robots, healthcare, education,
public safety and security, low-resource communities, employment and workplace,
and entertainment. It aims to provide the general public with a scientifically
and technologically accurate portrayal of the current state of AI and its
potential and to help guide decisions in industry and governments, as well as
to inform research and development in the field. The charge for this report was
given to the panel by the AI100 Standing Committee, chaired by Barbara Grosz of
Harvard University.
