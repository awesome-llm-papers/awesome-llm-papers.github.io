This paper describes AllenNLP, a platform for research on deep learning
methods in natural language understanding. AllenNLP is designed to support
researchers who want to build novel language understanding models quickly and
easily. It is built on top of PyTorch, allowing for dynamic computation graphs,
and provides (1) a flexible data API that handles intelligent batching and
padding, (2) high-level abstractions for common operations in working with
text, and (3) a modular and extensible experiment framework that makes doing
good science easy. It also includes reference implementations of high quality
approaches for both core semantic problems (e.g. semantic role labeling (Palmer
et al., 2005)) and language understanding applications (e.g. machine
comprehension (Rajpurkar et al., 2016)). AllenNLP is an ongoing open-source
effort maintained by engineers and researchers at the Allen Institute for
Artificial Intelligence.
