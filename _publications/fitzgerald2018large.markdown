We present a new large-scale corpus of Question-Answer driven Semantic Role
Labeling (QA-SRL) annotations, and the first high-quality QA-SRL parser. Our
corpus, QA-SRL Bank 2.0, consists of over 250,000 question-answer pairs for
over 64,000 sentences across 3 domains and was gathered with a new
crowd-sourcing scheme that we show has high precision and good recall at modest
cost. We also present neural models for two QA-SRL subtasks: detecting argument
spans for a predicate and generating questions to label the semantic
relationship. The best models achieve question accuracy of 82.6% and span-level
accuracy of 77.6% (under human evaluation) on the full pipelined QA-SRL
prediction task. They can also, as we show, be used to gather additional
annotations at low cost.
