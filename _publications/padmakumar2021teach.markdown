Robots operating in human spaces must be able to engage in natural language
interaction with people, both understanding and executing instructions, and
using conversation to resolve ambiguity and recover from mistakes. To study
this, we introduce TEACh, a dataset of over 3,000 human--human, interactive
dialogues to complete household tasks in simulation. A Commander with access to
oracle information about a task communicates in natural language with a
Follower. The Follower navigates through and interacts with the environment to
complete tasks varying in complexity from "Make Coffee" to "Prepare Breakfast",
asking questions and getting additional information from the Commander. We
propose three benchmarks using TEACh to study embodied intelligence challenges,
and we evaluate initial models' abilities in dialogue understanding, language
grounding, and task execution.
