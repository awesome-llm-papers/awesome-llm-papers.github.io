When building artificial intelligence systems that can reason and answer
questions about visual data, we need diagnostic tests to analyze our progress
and discover shortcomings. Existing benchmarks for visual question answering
can help, but have strong biases that models can exploit to correctly answer
questions without reasoning. They also conflate multiple sources of error,
making it hard to pinpoint model weaknesses. We present a diagnostic dataset
that tests a range of visual reasoning abilities. It contains minimal biases
and has detailed annotations describing the kind of reasoning each question
requires. We use this dataset to analyze a variety of modern visual reasoning
systems, providing novel insights into their abilities and limitations.
