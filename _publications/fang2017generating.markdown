Motivated by concerns for user privacy, we design a steganographic system
("stegosystem") that enables two users to exchange encrypted messages without
an adversary detecting that such an exchange is taking place. We propose a new
linguistic stegosystem based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.
We demonstrate our approach on the Twitter and Enron email datasets and show
that it yields high-quality steganographic text while significantly improving
capacity (encrypted bits per word) relative to the state-of-the-art.
