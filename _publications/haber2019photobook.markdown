This paper introduces the PhotoBook dataset, a large-scale collection of
visually-grounded, task-oriented dialogues in English designed to investigate
shared dialogue history accumulating during conversation. Taking inspiration
from seminal work on dialogue analysis, we propose a data-collection task
formulated as a collaborative game prompting two online participants to refer
to images utilising both their visual context as well as previously established
referring expressions. We provide a detailed description of the task setup and
a thorough analysis of the 2,500 dialogues collected. To further illustrate the
novel features of the dataset, we propose a baseline model for reference
resolution which uses a simple method to take into account shared information
accumulated in a reference chain. Our results show that this information is
particularly important to resolve later descriptions and underline the need to
develop more sophisticated models of common ground in dialogue interaction.
