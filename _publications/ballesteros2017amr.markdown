We present a transition-based AMR parser that directly generates AMR parses
from plain text. We use Stack-LSTMs to represent our parser state and make
decisions greedily. In our experiments, we show that our parser achieves very
competitive scores on English using only AMR training data. Adding additional
information, such as POS tags and dependency trees, improves the results
further.
