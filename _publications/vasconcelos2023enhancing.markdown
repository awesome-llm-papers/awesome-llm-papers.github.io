This study investigates the potential of ChatGPT and Bing Chat, advanced
conversational AIs, as "objects-to-think-with," resources that foster
reflective and critical thinking, and concept comprehension in enhancing STEM
education, using a constructionist theoretical framework. A single-case study
methodology was used to analyse extensive interaction logs between students and
both AI systems in simulated STEM learning experiences. The results highlight
the ability of ChatGPT and Bing Chat to help learners develop reflective and
critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving skills, and concept
comprehension. However, integrating AIs with collaborative learning and other
educational activities is crucial, as is addressing potential limitations like
concerns about AI information accuracy and reliability of the AIs' information
and diminished human interaction. The study concludes that ChatGPT and Bing
Chat as objects-to-think-with offer promising avenues to revolutionise STEM
education through a constructionist lens, fostering engagement in inclusive and
accessible learning environments.
