With recent advancements in diffusion models, users can generate high-quality
images by writing text prompts in natural language. However, generating images
with desired details requires proper prompts, and it is often unclear how a
model reacts to different prompts or what the best prompts are. To help
researchers tackle these critical challenges, we introduce DiffusionDB, the
first large-scale text-to-image prompt dataset totaling 6.5TB, containing 14
million images generated by Stable Diffusion, 1.8 million unique prompts, and
hyperparameters specified by real users. We analyze the syntactic and semantic
characteristics of prompts. We pinpoint specific hyperparameter values and
prompt styles that can lead to model errors and present evidence of potentially
harmful model usage, such as the generation of misinformation. The
unprecedented scale and diversity of this human-actuated dataset provide
exciting research opportunities in understanding the interplay between prompts
and generative models, detecting deepfakes, and designing human-AI interaction
tools to help users more easily use these models. DiffusionDB is publicly
