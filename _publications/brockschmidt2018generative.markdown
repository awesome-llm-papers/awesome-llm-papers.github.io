Generative models for source code are an interesting structured prediction
problem, requiring to reason about both hard syntactic and semantic constraints
as well as about natural, likely programs. We present a novel model for this
problem that uses a graph to represent the intermediate state of the generated
output. The generative procedure interleaves grammar-driven expansion steps
with graph augmentation and neural message passing steps. An experimental
evaluation shows that our new model can generate semantically meaningful
expressions, outperforming a range of strong baselines.
