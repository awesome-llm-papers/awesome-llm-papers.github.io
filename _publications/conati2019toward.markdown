Our research is a step toward ascertaining the need for personalization, in
XAI, and we do so in the context of investigating the value of explanations of
AI-driven hints and feedback are useful in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS).
We added an explanation functionality for the adaptive hints provided by the
Adaptive CSP (ACSP) applet, an interactive simulation that helps students learn
an algorithm for constraint satisfaction problems by providing AI-driven hints
adapted to their predicted level of learning. We present the design of the
explanation functionality and the results of a controlled study to evaluate its
impact on students' learning and perception of the ACPS hints. The study
includes an analysis of how these outcomes are modulated by several user
characteristics such as personality traits and cognitive abilities, to asses if
explanations should be personalized to these characteristics. Our results
indicate that providing explanations increase students' trust in the ACPS
hints, perceived usefulness of the hints, and intention to use them again. In
addition, we show that students' access of the explanation and learning gains
are modulated by user characteristics, providing insights toward designing
personalized Explainable AI (XAI) for ITS.
