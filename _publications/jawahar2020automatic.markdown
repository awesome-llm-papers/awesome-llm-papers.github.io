Text generative models (TGMs) excel in producing text that matches the style
of human language reasonably well. Such TGMs can be misused by adversaries,
e.g., by automatically generating fake news and fake product reviews that can
look authentic and fool humans. Detectors that can distinguish text generated
by TGM from human written text play a vital role in mitigating such misuse of
TGMs. Recently, there has been a flurry of works from both natural language
processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) communities to build accurate
detectors for English. Despite the importance of this problem, there is
currently no work that surveys this fast-growing literature and introduces
newcomers to important research challenges. In this work, we fill this void by
providing a critical survey and review of this literature to facilitate a
comprehensive understanding of this problem. We conduct an in-depth error
analysis of the state-of-the-art detector and discuss research directions to
guide future work in this exciting area.
