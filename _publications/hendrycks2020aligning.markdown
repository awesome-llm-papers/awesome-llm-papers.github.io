We show how to assess a language model's knowledge of basic concepts of
morality. We introduce the ETHICS dataset, a new benchmark that spans concepts
in justice, well-being, duties, virtues, and commonsense morality. Models
predict widespread moral judgments about diverse text scenarios. This requires
connecting physical and social world knowledge to value judgements, a
capability that may enable us to steer chatbot outputs or eventually regularize
open-ended reinforcement learning agents. With the ETHICS dataset, we find that
current language models have a promising but incomplete ability to predict
basic human ethical judgements. Our work shows that progress can be made on
machine ethics today, and it provides a steppingstone toward AI that is aligned
with human values.
