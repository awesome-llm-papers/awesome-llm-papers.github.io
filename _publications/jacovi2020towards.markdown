With the growing popularity of deep-learning based NLP models, comes a need
for interpretable systems. But what is interpretability, and what constitutes a
high-quality interpretation? In this opinion piece we reflect on the current
state of interpretability evaluation research. We call for more clearly
differentiating between different desired criteria an interpretation should
satisfy, and focus on the faithfulness criteria. We survey the literature with
respect to faithfulness evaluation, and arrange the current approaches around
three assumptions, providing an explicit form to how faithfulness is "defined"
by the community. We provide concrete guidelines on how evaluation of
interpretation methods should and should not be conducted. Finally, we claim
that the current binary definition for faithfulness sets a potentially
unrealistic bar for being considered faithful. We call for discarding the
binary notion of faithfulness in favor of a more graded one, which we believe
will be of greater practical utility.
