A key part of learning to program is learning to understand programming error
messages. They can be hard to interpret and identifying the cause of errors can
be time-consuming. One factor in this challenge is that the messages are
typically intended for an audience that already knows how to program, or even
for programming environments that then use the information to highlight areas
in code. Researchers have been working on making these errors more novice
friendly since the 1960s, however progress has been slow. The present work
contributes to this stream of research by using large language models to
enhance programming error messages with explanations of the errors and
suggestions on how to fix the error. Large language models can be used to
create useful and novice-friendly enhancements to programming error messages
that sometimes surpass the original programming error messages in
interpretability and actionability. These results provide further evidence of
the benefits of large language models for computing educators, highlighting
their use in areas known to be challenging for students. We further discuss the
benefits and downsides of large language models and highlight future streams of
research for enhancing programming error messages.
