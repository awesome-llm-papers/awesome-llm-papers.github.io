Translating in real-time, a.k.a. simultaneous translation, outputs
translation words before the input sentence ends, which is a challenging
problem for conventional machine translation methods. We propose a neural
machine translation (NMT) framework for simultaneous translation in which an
agent learns to make decisions on when to translate from the interaction with a
pre-trained NMT environment. To trade off quality and delay, we extensively
explore various targets for delay and design a method for beam-search
applicable in the simultaneous MT setting. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines on two language pairs demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
framework both quantitatively and qualitatively.
