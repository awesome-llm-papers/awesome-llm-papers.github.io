Text Simplification improves the readability of sentences through several
rewriting transformations, such as lexical paraphrasing, deletion, and
splitting. Current simplification systems are predominantly
sequence-to-sequence models that are trained end-to-end to perform all these
operations simultaneously. However, such systems limit themselves to mostly
deleting words and cannot easily adapt to the requirements of different target
audiences. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach that leverages
linguistically-motivated rules for splitting and deletion, and couples them
with a neural paraphrasing model to produce varied rewriting styles. We
introduce a new data augmentation method to improve the paraphrasing capability
of our model. Through automatic and manual evaluations, we show that our
proposed model establishes a new state-of-the-art for the task, paraphrasing
more often than the existing systems, and can control the degree of each
simplification operation applied to the input texts.
