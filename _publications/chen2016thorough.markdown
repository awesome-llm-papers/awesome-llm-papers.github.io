Enabling a computer to understand a document so that it can answer
comprehension questions is a central, yet unsolved goal of NLP. A key factor
impeding its solution by machine learned systems is the limited availability of
human-annotated data. Hermann et al. (2015) seek to solve this problem by
creating over a million training examples by pairing CNN and Daily Mail news
articles with their summarized bullet points, and show that a neural network
can then be trained to give good performance on this task. In this paper, we
conduct a thorough examination of this new reading comprehension task. Our
primary aim is to understand what depth of language understanding is required
to do well on this task. We approach this from one side by doing a careful
hand-analysis of a small subset of the problems and from the other by showing
that simple, carefully designed systems can obtain accuracies of 73.6% and
76.6% on these two datasets, exceeding current state-of-the-art results by
7-10% and approaching what we believe is the ceiling for performance on this
task.
