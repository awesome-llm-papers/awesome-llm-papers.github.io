Developers increasingly take to the Internet for code snippets to integrate
into their programs. To save developers the time required to switch from their
development environments to a web browser in the quest for a suitable code
snippet, we introduce NLP2Code, a content assist for code snippets. Unlike
related tools, NLP2Code integrates directly into the source code editor and
provides developers with a content assist feature to close the vocabulary gap
between developers' needs and code snippet meta data. Our preliminary
evaluation of NLP2Code shows that the majority of invocations lead to code
snippets rated as helpful by users and that the tool is able to support a wide
range of tasks.
