We address the problem of end-to-end visual storytelling. Given a photo
album, our model first selects the most representative (summary) photos, and
then composes a natural language story for the album. For this task, we make
use of the Visual Storytelling dataset and a model composed of three
hierarchically-attentive Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) to: encode the album
photos, select representative (summary) photos, and compose the story.
Automatic and human evaluations show our model achieves better performance on
selection, generation, and retrieval than baselines.
