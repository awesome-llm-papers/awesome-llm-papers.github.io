Session-based recommendations are highly relevant in many modern on-line
services (e.g. e-commerce, video streaming) and recommendation settings.
Recently, Recurrent Neural Networks have been shown to perform very well in
session-based settings. While in many session-based recommendation domains user
identifiers are hard to come by, there are also domains in which user profiles
are readily available. We propose a seamless way to personalize RNN models with
cross-session information transfer and devise a Hierarchical RNN model that
relays end evolves latent hidden states of the RNNs across user sessions.
Results on two industry datasets show large improvements over the session-only
RNNs.
