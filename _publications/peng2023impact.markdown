Generative AI tools hold promise to increase human productivity. This paper
presents results from a controlled experiment with GitHub Copilot, an AI pair
programmer. Recruited software developers were asked to implement an HTTP
server in JavaScript as quickly as possible. The treatment group, with access
to the AI pair programmer, completed the task 55.8% faster than the control
group. Observed heterogenous effects show promise for AI pair programmers to
help people transition into software development careers.
