We address a question answering task on real-world images that is set up as a
Visual Turing Test. By combining latest advances in image representation and
natural language processing, we propose Ask Your Neurons, a scalable, jointly
trained, end-to-end formulation to this problem.
  In contrast to previous efforts, we are facing a multi-modal problem where
the language output (answer) is conditioned on visual and natural language
inputs (image and question). We provide additional insights into the problem by
analyzing how much information is contained only in the language part for which
we provide a new human baseline. To study human consensus, which is related to
the ambiguities inherent in this challenging task, we propose two novel metrics
and collect additional answers which extend the original DAQUAR dataset to
DAQUAR-Consensus.
  Moreover, we also extend our analysis to VQA, a large-scale question
answering about images dataset, where we investigate some particular design
choices and show the importance of stronger visual models. At the same time, we
achieve strong performance of our model that still uses a global image
representation. Finally, based on such analysis, we refine our Ask Your Neurons
on DAQUAR, which also leads to a better performance on this challenging task.
