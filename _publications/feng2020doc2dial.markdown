We introduce doc2dial, a new dataset of goal-oriented dialogues that are
grounded in the associated documents. Inspired by how the authors compose
documents for guiding end users, we first construct dialogue flows based on the
content elements that corresponds to higher-level relations across text
sections as well as lower-level relations between discourse units within a
section. Then we present these dialogue flows to crowd contributors to create
conversational utterances. The dataset includes about 4800 annotated
conversations with an average of 14 turns that are grounded in over 480
documents from four domains. Compared to the prior document-grounded dialogue
datasets, this dataset covers a variety of dialogue scenes in
information-seeking conversations. For evaluating the versatility of the
dataset, we introduce multiple dialogue modeling tasks and present baseline
approaches.
