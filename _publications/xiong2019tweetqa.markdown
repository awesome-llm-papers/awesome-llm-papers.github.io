With social media becoming increasingly pop-ular on which lots of news and
real-time eventsare reported, developing automated questionanswering systems is
critical to the effective-ness of many applications that rely on real-time
knowledge. While previous datasets haveconcentrated on question answering (QA)
forformal text like news and Wikipedia, wepresent the first large-scale dataset
for QA oversocial media data. To ensure that the tweetswe collected are useful,
we only gather tweetsused by journalists to write news articles. Wethen ask
human annotators to write questionsand answers upon these tweets. Unlike
otherQA datasets like SQuAD in which the answersare extractive, we allow the
answers to be ab-stractive. We show that two recently proposedneural models
that perform well on formaltexts are limited in their performance when ap-plied
to our dataset. In addition, even the fine-tuned BERT model is still lagging
behind hu-man performance with a large margin. Our re-sults thus point to the
need of improved QAsystems targeting social media text.
