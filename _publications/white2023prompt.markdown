Prompt engineering is an increasingly important skill set needed to converse
effectively with large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. Prompts are
instructions given to an LLM to enforce rules, automate processes, and ensure
specific qualities (and quantities) of generated output. Prompts are also a
form of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with an
LLM. This paper describes a catalog of prompt engineering techniques presented
in pattern form that have been applied to solve common problems when conversing
with LLMs. Prompt patterns are a knowledge transfer method analogous to
software patterns since they provide reusable solutions to common problems
faced in a particular context, i.e., output generation and interaction when
working with LLMs. This paper provides the following contributions to research
on prompt engineering that apply LLMs to automate software development tasks.
First, it provides a framework for documenting patterns for structuring prompts
to solve a range of problems so that they can be adapted to different domains.
Second, it presents a catalog of patterns that have been applied successfully
to improve the outputs of LLM conversations. Third, it explains how prompts can
be built from multiple patterns and illustrates prompt patterns that benefit
from combination with other prompt patterns.
