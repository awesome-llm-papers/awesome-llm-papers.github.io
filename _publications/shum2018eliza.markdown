Conversational systems have come a long way since their inception in the
1960s. After decades of research and development, we've seen progress from
Eliza and Parry in the 60's and 70's, to task-completion systems as in the
DARPA Communicator program in the 2000s, to intelligent personal assistants
such as Siri in the 2010s, to today's social chatbots like XiaoIce. Social
chatbots' appeal lies not only in their ability to respond to users' diverse
requests, but also in being able to establish an emotional connection with
users. The latter is done by satisfying users' need for communication,
affection, as well as social belonging. To further the advancement and adoption
of social chatbots, their design must focus on user engagement and take both
intellectual quotient (IQ) and emotional quotient (EQ) into account. Users
should want to engage with a social chatbot; as such, we define the success
metric for social chatbots as conversation-turns per session (CPS). Using
XiaoIce as an illustrative example, we discuss key technologies in building
social chatbots from core chat to visual awareness to skills. We also show how
XiaoIce can dynamically recognize emotion and engage the user throughout long
conversations with appropriate interpersonal responses. As we become the first
generation of humans ever living with AI, we have a responsibility to design
social chatbots to be both useful and empathetic, so they will become
ubiquitous and help society as a whole.
