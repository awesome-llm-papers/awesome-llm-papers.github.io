Legal artificial intelligence (LegalAI) aims to benefit legal systems with
the technology of artificial intelligence, especially natural language
processing (NLP). Recently, inspired by the success of pre-trained language
models (PLMs) in the generic domain, many LegalAI researchers devote their
effort to apply PLMs to legal tasks. However, utilizing PLMs to address legal
tasks is still challenging, as the legal documents usually consist of thousands
of tokens, which is far longer than the length that mainstream PLMs can
process. In this paper, we release the Longformer-based pre-trained language
model, named as Lawformer, for Chinese legal long documents understanding. We
evaluate Lawformer on a variety of LegalAI tasks, including judgment
prediction, similar case retrieval, legal reading comprehension, and legal
question answering. The experimental results demonstrate that our model can
achieve promising improvement on tasks with long documents as inputs.
