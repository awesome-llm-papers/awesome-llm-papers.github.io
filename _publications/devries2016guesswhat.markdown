We introduce GuessWhat?!, a two-player guessing game as a testbed for
research on the interplay of computer vision and dialogue systems. The goal of
the game is to locate an unknown object in a rich image scene by asking a
sequence of questions. Higher-level image understanding, like spatial reasoning
and language grounding, is required to solve the proposed task. Our key
contribution is the collection of a large-scale dataset consisting of 150K
human-played games with a total of 800K visual question-answer pairs on 66K
images. We explain our design decisions in collecting the dataset and introduce
the oracle and questioner tasks that are associated with the two players of the
game. We prototyped deep learning models to establish initial baselines of the
introduced tasks.
