Using natural language as a supervision for training visual recognition
models holds great promise. Recent works have shown that if such supervision is
used in the form of alignment between images and captions in large training
datasets, then the resulting aligned models perform well on zero-shot
classification as downstream tasks2. In this paper, we focus on teasing out
what parts of the language supervision are essential for training zero-shot
image classification models. Through extensive and careful experiments, we show
that: 1) A simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) caption could be used as a replacement for
most of the image captions in the dataset. Surprisingly, we observe that this
approach improves the zero-shot classification performance when combined with
word balancing. 2) Using a BoW pretrained model, we can obtain more training
data by generating pseudo-BoW captions on images that do not have a caption.
Models trained on images with real and pseudo-BoW captions achieve stronger
zero-shot performance. On ImageNet-1k zero-shot evaluation, our best model,
that uses only 3M image-caption pairs, performs on-par with a CLIP model
trained on 15M image-caption pairs (31.5% vs 31.3%).
