We present ConvLab, an open-source multi-domain end-to-end dialog system
platform, that enables researchers to quickly set up experiments with reusable
components and compare a large set of different approaches, ranging from
conventional pipeline systems to end-to-end neural models, in common
environments. ConvLab offers a set of fully annotated datasets and associated
pre-trained reference models. As a showcase, we extend the MultiWOZ dataset
with user dialog act annotations to train all component models and demonstrate
how ConvLab makes it easy and effortless to conduct complicated experiments in
multi-domain end-to-end dialog settings.
