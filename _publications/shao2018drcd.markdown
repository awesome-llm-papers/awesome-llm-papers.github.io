In this paper, we introduce DRCD (Delta Reading Comprehension Dataset), an
open domain traditional Chinese machine reading comprehension (MRC) dataset.
This dataset aimed to be a standard Chinese machine reading comprehension
dataset, which can be a source dataset in transfer learning. The dataset
contains 10,014 paragraphs from 2,108 Wikipedia articles and 30,000+ questions
generated by annotators. We build a baseline model that achieves an F1 score of
89.59%. F1 score of Human performance is 93.30%.
