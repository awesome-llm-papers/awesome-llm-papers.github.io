Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs)
are marvels of technology; celebrated for their prowess in natural language
processing and multimodal content generation, they promise a transformative
future. But as with all powerful tools, they come with their shadows. Picture
living in a world where deepfakes are indistinguishable from reality, where
synthetic identities orchestrate malicious campaigns, and where targeted
misinformation or scams are crafted with unparalleled precision. Welcome to the
darker side of GenAI applications. This article is not just a journey through
the meanders of potential misuse of GenAI and LLMs, but also a call to
recognize the urgency of the challenges ahead. As we navigate the seas of
misinformation campaigns, malicious content generation, and the eerie creation
of sophisticated malware, we'll uncover the societal implications that ripple
through the GenAI revolution we are witnessing. From AI-powered botnets on
social media platforms to the unnerving potential of AI to generate fabricated
identities, or alibis made of synthetic realities, the stakes have never been
higher. The lines between the virtual and the real worlds are blurring, and the
consequences of potential GenAI's nefarious applications impact us all. This
article serves both as a synthesis of rigorous research presented on the risks
of GenAI and misuse of LLMs and as a thought-provoking vision of the different
types of harmful GenAI applications we might encounter in the near future, and
some ways we can prepare for them.
