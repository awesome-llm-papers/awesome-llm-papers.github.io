We present Sounding Board, a social chatbot that won the 2017 Amazon Alexa
Prize. The system architecture consists of several components including spoken
language processing, dialogue management, language generation, and content
management, with emphasis on user-centric and content-driven design. We also
share insights gained from large-scale online logs based on 160,000
conversations with real-world users.
