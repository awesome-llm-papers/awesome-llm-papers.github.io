Spoken Language Understanding infers semantic meaning directly from audio
data, and thus promises to reduce error propagation and misunderstandings in
end-user applications. However, publicly available SLU resources are limited.
In this paper, we release SLURP, a new SLU package containing the following:
(1) A new challenging dataset in English spanning 18 domains, which is
substantially bigger and linguistically more diverse than existing datasets;
(2) Competitive baselines based on state-of-the-art NLU and ASR systems; (3) A
new transparent metric for entity labelling which enables a detailed error
analysis for identifying potential areas of improvement. SLURP is available at
