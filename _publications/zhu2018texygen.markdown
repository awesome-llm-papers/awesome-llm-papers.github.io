We introduce Texygen, a benchmarking platform to support research on
open-domain text generation models. Texygen has not only implemented a majority
of text generation models, but also covered a set of metrics that evaluate the
diversity, the quality and the consistency of the generated texts. The Texygen
platform could help standardize the research on text generation and facilitate
the sharing of fine-tuned open-source implementations among researchers for
their work. As a consequence, this would help in improving the reproductivity
and reliability of future research work in text generation.
