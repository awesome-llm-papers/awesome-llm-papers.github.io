Our goal is to create a convenient natural language interface for performing
well-specified but complex actions such as analyzing data, manipulating text,
and querying databases. However, existing natural language interfaces for such
tasks are quite primitive compared to the power one wields with a programming
language. To bridge this gap, we start with a core programming language and
allow users to "naturalize" the core language incrementally by defining
alternative, more natural syntax and increasingly complex concepts in terms of
compositions of simpler ones. In a voxel world, we show that a community of
users can simultaneously teach a common system a diverse language and use it to
build hundreds of complex voxel structures. Over the course of three days,
these users went from using only the core language to using the naturalized
language in 85.9% of the last 10K utterances.
