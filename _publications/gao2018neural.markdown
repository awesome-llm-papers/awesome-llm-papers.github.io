The present paper surveys neural approaches to conversational AI that have
been developed in the last few years. We group conversational systems into
three categories: (1) question answering agents, (2) task-oriented dialogue
agents, and (3) chatbots. For each category, we present a review of
state-of-the-art neural approaches, draw the connection between them and
traditional approaches, and discuss the progress that has been made and
challenges still being faced, using specific systems and models as case
studies.
