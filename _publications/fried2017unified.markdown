We show that explicit pragmatic inference aids in correctly generating and
following natural language instructions for complex, sequential tasks. Our
pragmatics-enabled models reason about why speakers produce certain
instructions, and about how listeners will react upon hearing them. Like
previous pragmatic models, we use learned base listener and speaker models to
build a pragmatic speaker that uses the base listener to simulate the
interpretation of candidate descriptions, and a pragmatic listener that reasons
counterfactually about alternative descriptions. We extend these models to
tasks with sequential structure. Evaluation of language generation and
interpretation shows that pragmatic inference improves state-of-the-art
listener models (at correctly interpreting human instructions) and speaker
models (at producing instructions correctly interpreted by humans) in diverse
settings.
