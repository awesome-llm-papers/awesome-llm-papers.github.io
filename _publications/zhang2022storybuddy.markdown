Despite its benefits for children's skill development and parent-child
bonding, many parents do not often engage in interactive storytelling by having
story-related dialogues with their child due to limited availability or
challenges in coming up with appropriate questions. While recent advances made
AI generation of questions from stories possible, the fully-automated approach
excludes parent involvement, disregards educational goals, and underoptimizes
for child engagement. Informed by need-finding interviews and participatory
design (PD) results, we developed StoryBuddy, an AI-enabled system for parents
to create interactive storytelling experiences. StoryBuddy's design highlighted
the need for accommodating dynamic user needs between the desire for parent
involvement and parent-child bonding and the goal of minimizing parent
intervention when busy. The PD revealed varied assessment and educational goals
of parents, which StoryBuddy addressed by supporting configuring question types
and tracking child progress. A user study validated StoryBuddy's usability and
suggested design insights for future parent-AI collaboration systems.
