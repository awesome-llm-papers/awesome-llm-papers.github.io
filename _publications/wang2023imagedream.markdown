We introduce "ImageDream," an innovative image-prompt, multi-view diffusion model for 3D object generation. ImageDream stands out for its ability to produce 3D models of higher quality compared to existing state-of-the-art, image-conditioned methods. Our approach utilizes a canonical camera coordination for the objects in images, improving visual geometry accuracy. The model is designed with various levels of control at each block inside the diffusion model based on the input image, where global control shapes the overall object layout and local control fine-tunes the image details. The effectiveness of ImageDream is demonstrated through extensive evaluations using a standard prompt list. For more information, visit our project page at https://Image-Dream.github.io.
