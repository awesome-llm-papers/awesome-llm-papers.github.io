Existing neural conversational models process natural language primarily on a
lexico-syntactic level, thereby ignoring one of the most crucial components of
human-to-human dialogue: its affective content. We take a step in this
direction by proposing three novel ways to incorporate affective/emotional
aspects into long short term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder neural conversation
models: (1) affective word embeddings, which are cognitively engineered, (2)
affect-based objective functions that augment the standard cross-entropy loss,
and (3) affectively diverse beam search for decoding. Experiments show that
these techniques improve the open-domain conversational prowess of
encoder-decoder networks by enabling them to produce emotionally rich responses
that are more interesting and natural.
