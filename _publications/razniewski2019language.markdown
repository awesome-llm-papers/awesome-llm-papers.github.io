Pre-trained language models (LMs) have recently gained attention for their
potential as an alternative to (or proxy for) explicit knowledge bases (KBs).
In this position paper, we examine this hypothesis, identify strengths and
limitations of both LMs and KBs, and discuss the complementary nature of the
two paradigms. In particular, we offer qualitative arguments that latent LMs
are not suitable as a substitute for explicit KBs, but could play a major role
for augmenting and curating KBs.
