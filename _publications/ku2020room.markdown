We introduce Room-Across-Room (RxR), a new Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN) dataset. RxR is multilingual (English, Hindi, and Telugu) and larger
(more paths and instructions) than other VLN datasets. It emphasizes the role
of language in VLN by addressing known biases in paths and eliciting more
references to visible entities. Furthermore, each word in an instruction is
time-aligned to the virtual poses of instruction creators and validators. We
establish baseline scores for monolingual and multilingual settings and
multitask learning when including Room-to-Room annotations. We also provide
results for a model that learns from synchronized pose traces by focusing only
on portions of the panorama attended to in human demonstrations. The size,
scope and detail of RxR dramatically expands the frontier for research on
embodied language agents in simulated, photo-realistic environments.
