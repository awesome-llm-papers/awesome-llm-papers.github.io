Over the past decade, large-scale supervised learning corpora have enabled
machine learning researchers to make substantial advances. However, to this
date, there are no large-scale question-answer corpora available. In this paper
we present the 30M Factoid Question-Answer Corpus, an enormous question answer
pair corpus produced by applying a novel neural network architecture on the
knowledge base Freebase to transduce facts into natural language questions. The
produced question answer pairs are evaluated both by human evaluators and using
automatic evaluation metrics, including well-established machine translation
and sentence similarity metrics. Across all evaluation criteria the
question-generation model outperforms the competing template-based baseline.
Furthermore, when presented to human evaluators, the generated questions appear
comparable in quality to real human-generated questions.
