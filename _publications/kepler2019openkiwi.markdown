We introduce OpenKiwi, a PyTorch-based open source framework for translation
quality estimation. OpenKiwi supports training and testing of word-level and
sentence-level quality estimation systems, implementing the winning systems of
the WMT 2015-18 quality estimation campaigns. We benchmark OpenKiwi on two
datasets from WMT 2018 (English-German SMT and NMT), yielding state-of-the-art
performance on the word-level tasks and near state-of-the-art in the
sentence-level tasks.
