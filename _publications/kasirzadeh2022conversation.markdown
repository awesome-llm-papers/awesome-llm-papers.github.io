Large-scale language technologies are increasingly used in various forms of
communication with humans across different contexts. One particular use case
for these technologies is conversational agents, which output natural language
text in response to prompts and queries. This mode of engagement raises a
number of social and ethical questions. For example, what does it mean to align
conversational agents with human norms or values? Which norms or values should
they be aligned with? And how can this be accomplished? In this paper, we
propose a number of steps that help answer these questions. We start by
developing a philosophical analysis of the building blocks of linguistic
communication between conversational agents and human interlocutors. We then
use this analysis to identify and formulate ideal norms of conversation that
can govern successful linguistic communication between humans and
conversational agents. Furthermore, we explore how these norms can be used to
align conversational agents with human values across a range of different
discursive domains. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our
proposal for the design of conversational agents that are aligned with these
norms and values.
