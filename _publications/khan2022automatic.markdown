Source code documentation is an important artifact for efficient software
development. Code documentation could greatly benefit from automation since
manual documentation is often labouring, resource and time-intensive. In this
paper, we employed Codex for automatic code documentation creation. Codex is a
GPT-3 based model pre-trained on both natural and programming languages. We
find that Codex outperforms existing techniques even with basic settings like
one-shot learning (i.e., providing only one example for training). Codex
achieves an overall BLEU score of 20.6 for six different programming languages
(11.2% improvement over earlier state-of-the-art techniques). Thus, Codex shows
promise and warrants in-depth future studies for automatic code documentation
generation to support diverse development tasks.
