With children talking to smart-speakers, smart-phones and even
smart-microwaves daily, it is increasingly important to educate students on how
these agents work-from underlying mechanisms to societal implications.
Researchers are developing tools and curriculum to teach K-12 students broadly
about artificial intelligence (AI); however, few studies have evaluated these
tools with respect to AI-specific learning outcomes, and even fewer have
addressed student learning about AI-based conversational agents. We evaluate
our Conversational Agent Interface for MIT App Inventor and workshop curriculum
with respect to eight AI competencies from the literature. Furthermore, we
analyze teacher (n=9) and student (n=47) feedback from workshops with the
interface and recommend that future work leverages design considerations from
the literature to optimize engagement, collaborates with teachers, and
addresses a range of student abilities through pacing and opportunities for
extension. We found students struggled most with the concepts of AI ethics and
learning, and recommend emphasizing these topics when teaching.
