The DALL-E 2 system generates original synthetic images corresponding to an
input text as caption. We report here on the outcome of fourteen tests of this
system designed to assess its common sense, reasoning and ability to understand
complex texts. All of our prompts were intentionally much more challenging than
the typical ones that have been showcased in recent weeks. Nevertheless, for 5
out of the 14 prompts, at least one of the ten images fully satisfied our
requests. On the other hand, on no prompt did all of the ten images satisfy our
requests.
