Long short-term memory (LSTM) has been widely used for sequential data
modeling. Researchers have increased LSTM depth by stacking LSTM cells to
improve performance. This incurs model redundancy, increases run-time delay,
and makes the LSTMs more prone to overfitting. To address these problems, we
propose a hidden-layer LSTM (H-LSTM) that adds hidden layers to LSTM's original
one level non-linear control gates. H-LSTM increases accuracy while employing
fewer external stacked layers, thus reducing the number of parameters and
run-time latency significantly. We employ grow-and-prune (GP) training to
iteratively adjust the hidden layers through gradient-based growth and
magnitude-based pruning of connections. This learns both the weights and the
compact architecture of H-LSTM control gates. We have GP-trained H-LSTMs for
image captioning and speech recognition applications. For the NeuralTalk
architecture on the MSCOCO dataset, our three models reduce the number of
parameters by 38.7x [floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 45.5x], run-time
latency by 4.5x, and improve the CIDEr score by 2.6. For the DeepSpeech2
architecture on the AN4 dataset, our two models reduce the number of parameters
by 19.4x (FLOPs by 23.5x), run-time latency by 15.7%, and the word error rate
from 12.9% to 8.7%. Thus, GP-trained H-LSTMs can be seen to be compact, fast,
and accurate.
