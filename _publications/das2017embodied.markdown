We present a new AI task -- Embodied Question Answering (EmbodiedQA) -- where
an agent is spawned at a random location in a 3D environment and asked a
question ("What color is the car?"). In order to answer, the agent must first
intelligently navigate to explore the environment, gather information through
first-person (egocentric) vision, and then answer the question ("orange").
  This challenging task requires a range of AI skills -- active perception,
language understanding, goal-driven navigation, commonsense reasoning, and
grounding of language into actions. In this work, we develop the environments,
end-to-end-trained reinforcement learning agents, and evaluation protocols for
EmbodiedQA.
