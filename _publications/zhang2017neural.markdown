In this paper, we focus on the personalized response generation for
conversational systems. Based on the sequence to sequence learning, especially
the encoder-decoder framework, we propose a two-phase approach, namely
initialization then adaptation, to model the responding style of human and then
generate personalized responses. For evaluation, we propose a novel human aided
method to evaluate the performance of the personalized response generation
models by online real-time conversation and offline human judgement. Moreover,
the lexical divergence of the responses generated by the 5 personalized models
indicates that the proposed two-phase approach achieves good results on
modeling the responding style of human and generating personalized responses
for the conversational systems.
