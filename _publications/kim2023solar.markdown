We introduce depth up-scaling (DUS), a novel technique to up-scale base LLMs efficiently and effectively in a simple manner. In contrast to mixture-of-experts (MoE), DUS does not require complex changes to train and inference. Using DUS, we build SOLAR 10.7B, a large language model (LLM) with 10.7 billion parameters, demonstrating superior performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Comparative evaluations show that SOLAR 10.7B outperforms existing open-source pretrained LLMs, such as Llama 2 and Mistral 7B. We additionally present SOLAR 10.7B-Instruct, a variant fine-tuned for instruction-following capabilities, surpassing Mixtral-8x7B. SOLAR 10.7B is publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license, promoting broad access and application in the LLM field.
