Reasoning, as an essential ability for complex problem-solving, can provide
back-end support for various real-world applications, such as medical
diagnosis, negotiation, etc. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of
cutting-edge research on reasoning with language model prompting. We introduce
research works with comparisons and summaries and provide systematic resources
to help beginners. We also discuss the potential reasons for emerging such
reasoning abilities and highlight future research directions. Resources are
