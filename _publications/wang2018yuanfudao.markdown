This paper describes our system for SemEval-2018 Task 11: Machine
Comprehension using Commonsense Knowledge. We use Three-way Attentive Networks
(TriAN) to model interactions between the passage, question and answers. To
incorporate commonsense knowledge, we augment the input with relation embedding
from the graph of general knowledge ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017). As a
result, our system achieves state-of-the-art performance with 83.95% accuracy
on the official test data. Code is publicly available at
