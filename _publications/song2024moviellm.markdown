The development of multimodal models has marked a significant step forward in how machines understand videos. These models have shown promise in analyzing short video clips. However, when it comes to longer formats like movies, they often fall short. The main hurdles are the lack of high-quality, diverse video data and the intensive work required to collect or annotate such data. In the face of these challenges, we propose MovieLLM, a novel framework designed to create synthetic, high-quality data for long videos. This framework leverages the power of GPT-4 and text-to-image models to generate detailed scripts and corresponding visuals. Our approach stands out for its flexibility and scalability, making it a superior alternative to traditional data collection methods. Our extensive experiments validate that the data produced by MovieLLM significantly improves the performance of multimodal models in understanding complex video narratives, overcoming the limitations of existing datasets regarding scarcity and bias.
