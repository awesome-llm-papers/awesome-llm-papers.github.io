We present ToTTo, an open-domain English table-to-text dataset with over
120,000 training examples that proposes a controlled generation task: given a
Wikipedia table and a set of highlighted table cells, produce a one-sentence
description. To obtain generated targets that are natural but also faithful to
the source table, we introduce a dataset construction process where annotators
directly revise existing candidate sentences from Wikipedia. We present
systematic analyses of our dataset and annotation process as well as results
achieved by several state-of-the-art baselines. While usually fluent, existing
methods often hallucinate phrases that are not supported by the table,
suggesting that this dataset can serve as a useful research benchmark for
high-precision conditional text generation.
