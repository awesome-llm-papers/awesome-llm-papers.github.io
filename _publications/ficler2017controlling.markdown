Most work on neural natural language generation (NNLG) focus on controlling
the content of the generated text. We experiment with controlling several
stylistic aspects of the generated text, in addition to its content. The method
is based on conditioned RNN language model, where the desired content as well
as the stylistic parameters serve as conditioning contexts. We demonstrate the
approach on the movie reviews domain and show that it is successful in
generating coherent sentences corresponding to the required linguistic style
and content.
