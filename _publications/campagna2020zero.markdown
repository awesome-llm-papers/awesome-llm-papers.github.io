Zero-shot transfer learning for multi-domain dialogue state tracking can
allow us to handle new domains without incurring the high cost of data
acquisition. This paper proposes new zero-short transfer learning technique for
dialogue state tracking where the in-domain training data are all synthesized
from an abstract dialogue model and the ontology of the domain. We show that
data augmentation through synthesized data can improve the accuracy of
zero-shot learning for both the TRADE model and the BERT-based SUMBT model on
the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset. We show training with only synthesized in-domain data
on the SUMBT model can reach about 2/3 of the accuracy obtained with the full
training dataset. We improve the zero-shot learning state of the art on average
across domains by 21%.
