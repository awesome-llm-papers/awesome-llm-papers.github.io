In this paper, we propose to study the problem of COURT VIEW GENeration from
the fact description in a criminal case. The task aims to improve the
interpretability of charge prediction systems and help automatic legal document
generation. We formulate this task as a text-to-text natural language
generation (NLG) problem. Sequenceto-sequence model has achieved cutting-edge
performances in many NLG tasks. However, due to the non-distinctions of fact
descriptions, it is hard for Seq2Seq model to generate charge-discriminative
court views. In this work, we explore charge labels to tackle this issue. We
propose a label-conditioned Seq2Seq model with attention for this problem, to
decode court views conditioned on encoded charge labels. Experimental results
show the effectiveness of our method.
