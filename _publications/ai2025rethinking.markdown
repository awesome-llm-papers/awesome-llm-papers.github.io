A language model's ability to reflect on its own reasoning provides a key
advantage for solving complex problems. While most recent research has focused
on how this ability develops during reinforcement learning, we show that it
actually begins to emerge much earlier - during the model's pre-training. To
study this, we introduce deliberate errors into chains-of-thought and test
whether the model can still arrive at the correct answer by recognizing and
correcting these mistakes. By tracking performance across different stages of
pre-training, we observe that this self-correcting ability appears early and
improves steadily over time. For instance, an OLMo2-7B model pre-trained on 4
trillion tokens displays self-correction on our six self-reflection tasks.
