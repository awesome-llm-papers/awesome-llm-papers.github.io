We present Joey NMT, a minimalist neural machine translation toolkit based on
PyTorch that is specifically designed for novices. Joey NMT provides many
popular NMT features in a small and simple code base, so that novices can
easily and quickly learn to use it and adapt it to their needs. Despite its
focus on simplicity, Joey NMT supports classic architectures (RNNs,
transformers), fast beam search, weight tying, and more, and achieves
performance comparable to more complex toolkits on standard benchmarks. We
evaluate the accessibility of our toolkit in a user study where novices with
general knowledge about Pytorch and NMT and experts work through a
self-contained Joey NMT tutorial, showing that novices perform almost as well
as experts in a subsequent code quiz. Joey NMT is available at
