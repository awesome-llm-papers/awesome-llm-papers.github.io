The recent application of RNN encoder-decoder models has resulted in
substantial progress in fully data-driven dialogue systems, but evaluation
remains a challenge. An adversarial loss could be a way to directly evaluate
the extent to which generated dialogue responses sound like they came from a
human. This could reduce the need for human evaluation, while more directly
evaluating on a generative task. In this work, we investigate this idea by
training an RNN to discriminate a dialogue model's samples from human-generated
samples. Although we find some evidence this setup could be viable, we also
note that many issues remain in its practical application. We discuss both
aspects and conclude that future work is warranted.
