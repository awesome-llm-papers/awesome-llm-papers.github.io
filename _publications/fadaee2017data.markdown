The quality of a Neural Machine Translation system depends substantially on
the availability of sizable parallel corpora. For low-resource language pairs
this is not the case, resulting in poor translation quality. Inspired by work
in computer vision, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that targets
low-frequency words by generating new sentence pairs containing rare words in
new, synthetically created contexts. Experimental results on simulated
low-resource settings show that our method improves translation quality by up
to 2.9 BLEU points over the baseline and up to 3.2 BLEU over back-translation.
