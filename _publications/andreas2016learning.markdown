We describe a question answering model that applies to both images and
structured knowledge bases. The model uses natural language strings to
automatically assemble neural networks from a collection of composable modules.
Parameters for these modules are learned jointly with network-assembly
parameters via reinforcement learning, with only (world, question, answer)
triples as supervision. Our approach, which we term a dynamic neural model
network, achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets in both visual
and structured domains.
