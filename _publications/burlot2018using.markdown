Neural Machine Translation (MT) has radically changed the way systems are
developed. A major difference with the previous generation (Phrase-Based MT) is
the way monolingual target data, which often abounds, is used in these two
paradigms. While Phrase-Based MT can seamlessly integrate very large language
models trained on billions of sentences, the best option for Neural MT
developers seems to be the generation of artificial parallel data through
\textsl\{back-translation\} - a technique that fails to fully take advantage of
existing datasets. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of
back-translation, comparing alternative uses of monolingual data, as well as
multiple data generation procedures. Our findings confirm that back-translation
is very effective and give new explanations as to why this is the case. We also
introduce new data simulation techniques that are almost as effective, yet much
cheaper to implement.
