We present the MASSIVE dataset--Multilingual Amazon Slu resource package
(SLURP) for Slot-filling, Intent classification, and Virtual assistant
Evaluation. MASSIVE contains 1M realistic, parallel, labeled virtual assistant
utterances spanning 51 languages, 18 domains, 60 intents, and 55 slots. MASSIVE
was created by tasking professional translators to localize the English-only
SLURP dataset into 50 typologically diverse languages from 29 genera. We also
present modeling results on XLM-R and mT5, including exact match accuracy,
intent classification accuracy, and slot-filling F1 score. We have released our
dataset, modeling code, and models publicly.
