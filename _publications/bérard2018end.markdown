We investigate end-to-end speech-to-text translation on a corpus of
audiobooks specifically augmented for this task. Previous works investigated
the extreme case where source language transcription is not available during
learning nor decoding, but we also study a midway case where source language
transcription is available at training time only. In this case, a single model
is trained to decode source speech into target text in a single pass.
Experimental results show that it is possible to train compact and efficient
end-to-end speech translation models in this setup. We also distribute the
corpus and hope that our speech translation baseline on this corpus will be
challenged in the future.
