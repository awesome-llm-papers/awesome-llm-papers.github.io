We describe an effort to annotate a corpus of natural language instructions
consisting of 622 wet lab protocols to facilitate automatic or semi-automatic
conversion of protocols into a machine-readable format and benefit biological
research. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of our corpus for
developing machine learning approaches to shallow semantic parsing of
instructional texts. We make our annotated Wet Lab Protocol Corpus available to
the research community.
