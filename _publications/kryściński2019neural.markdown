Text summarization aims at compressing long documents into a shorter form
that conveys the most important parts of the original document. Despite
increased interest in the community and notable research effort, progress on
benchmark datasets has stagnated. We critically evaluate key ingredients of the
current research setup: datasets, evaluation metrics, and models, and highlight
three primary shortcomings: 1) automatically collected datasets leave the task
underconstrained and may contain noise detrimental to training and evaluation,
2) current evaluation protocol is weakly correlated with human judgment and
does not account for important characteristics such as factual correctness, 3)
models overfit to layout biases of current datasets and offer limited diversity
in their outputs.
