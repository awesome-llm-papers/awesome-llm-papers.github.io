Software Engineering (SE) is the systematic design, development, maintenance,
and management of software applications underpinning the digital infrastructure
of our modern world. Very recently, the SE community has seen a rapidly
increasing number of techniques employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to
automate a broad range of SE tasks. Nevertheless, existing information of the
applications, effects, and possible limitations of LLMs within SE is still not
well-studied.
  In this paper, we provide a systematic survey to summarize the current
state-of-the-art research in the LLM-based SE community. We summarize 62
representative LLMs of Code across three model architectures, 15 pre-training
objectives across four categories, and 16 downstream tasks across five
categories. We then present a detailed summarization of the recent SE studies
for which LLMs are commonly utilized, including 947 studies for 112 specific
code-related tasks across five crucial phases within the SE workflow. We also
discuss several critical aspects during the integration of LLMs into SE, such
as empirical evaluation, benchmarking, security and reliability, domain tuning,
compressing and distillation. Finally, we highlight several challenges and
potential opportunities on applying LLMs for future SE studies, such as
exploring domain LLMs and constructing clean evaluation datasets. Overall, our
work can help researchers gain a comprehensive understanding about the
achievements of the existing LLM-based SE studies and promote the practical
application of these techniques. Our artifacts are publicly available and will
be continuously updated at the living repository:
