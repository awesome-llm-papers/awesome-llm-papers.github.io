Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis is a technology that converts written text
into spoken words, enabling a natural and accessible means of communication.
This abstract explores the key aspects of TTS synthesis, encompassing its
underlying technologies, applications, and implications for various sectors.
The technology utilizes advanced algorithms and linguistic models to convert
textual information into life like speech, allowing for enhanced user
experiences in diverse contexts such as accessibility tools, navigation
systems, and virtual assistants. The abstract delves into the challenges and
advancements in TTS synthesis, including considerations for naturalness,
multilingual support, and emotional expression in synthesized speech.
