Generating diverse questions for given images is an important task for
computational education, entertainment and AI assistants. Different from many
conventional prediction techniques is the need for algorithms to generate a
diverse set of plausible questions, which we refer to as "creativity". In this
paper we propose a creative algorithm for visual question generation which
combines the advantages of variational autoencoders with long short-term memory
networks. We demonstrate that our framework is able to generate a large set of
varying questions given a single input image.
