Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) research has grown significantly in
recent years. A number of software offerings now exist that provide stable,
comprehensive implementations for benchmarking. At the same time, recent deep
RL research has become more diverse in its goals. In this paper we introduce
Dopamine, a new research framework for deep RL that aims to support some of
that diversity. Dopamine is open-source, TensorFlow-based, and provides compact
and reliable implementations of some state-of-the-art deep RL agents. We
complement this offering with a taxonomy of the different research objectives
in deep RL research. While by no means exhaustive, our analysis highlights the
heterogeneity of research in the field, and the value of frameworks such as
ours.
