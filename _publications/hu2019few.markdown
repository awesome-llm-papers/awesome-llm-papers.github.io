Existing approaches for learning word embeddings often assume there are
sufficient occurrences for each word in the corpus, such that the
representation of words can be accurately estimated from their contexts.
However, in real-world scenarios, out-of-vocabulary (a.k.a. OOV) words that do
not appear in training corpus emerge frequently. It is challenging to learn
accurate representations of these words with only a few observations. In this
paper, we formulate the learning of OOV embeddings as a few-shot regression
problem, and address it by training a representation function to predict the
oracle embedding vector (defined as embedding trained with abundant
observations) based on limited observations. Specifically, we propose a novel
hierarchical attention-based architecture to serve as the neural regression
function, with which the context information of a word is encoded and
aggregated from K observations. Furthermore, our approach can leverage
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for adapting the learned model to the new
corpus fast and robustly. Experiments show that the proposed approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing accurate embeddings
for OOV words, and improves downstream tasks where these embeddings are
utilized.
