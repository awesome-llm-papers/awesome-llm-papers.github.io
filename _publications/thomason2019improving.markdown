Natural language understanding for robotics can require substantial domain-
and platform-specific engineering. For example, for mobile robots to
pick-and-place objects in an environment to satisfy human commands, we can
specify the language humans use to issue such commands, and connect concept
words like red can to physical object properties. One way to alleviate this
engineering for a new domain is to enable robots in human environments to adapt
dynamically---continually learning new language constructions and perceptual
concepts. In this work, we present an end-to-end pipeline for translating
natural language commands to discrete robot actions, and use clarification
dialogs to jointly improve language parsing and concept grounding. We train and
evaluate this agent in a virtual setting on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and we
transfer the learned agent to a physical robot platform to demonstrate it in
the real world.
