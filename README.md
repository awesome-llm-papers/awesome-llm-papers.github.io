## 🧭 Why This Exists

The field of LLMs is growing at breakneck speed.

Every week brings a wave of new papers on prompting, fine-tuning, evaluation, RAG, and more. Traditional search tools make it hard to keep track, compare, or explore emerging trends.

**LLM Bible** solves that by providing an **interactive, topic-clustered map** of LLM papers — with filters, search, and direct links to arXiv.

## ✨ Features

- 📌 **2D Visualization:** Explore papers spatially via t-SNE clustering  
- 🔍 **Search:** Instantly filter by title, author, or key topics (e.g., "prompting", "RAG")  
- 📅 **Filter by year:** Focus on recent or historical research  
- 🏷️ **Tag-based discovery:** See papers grouped by categories like evaluation, agents, multimodal, etc.  
- 🚀 **No login, no ads, no fluff — just open research**
